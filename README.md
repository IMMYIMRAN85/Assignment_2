# Guess the Number Game  (Git Branching Practice)

This project is a simple Python **Guess the Number** game used to practice **Git branching and merging**.

## Project Goal
- Create a basic Python game.
- Make changes on **three different branches**.
- Merge each branch back into the `main` branch.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code / Terminal

## Game Description
The program selects a random number.  
The player must guess the correct number.

We will improve the game in steps using branches:
1. **feature/prompt-text** — add friendly text prompts
2. **feature/validation** — validate user input
3. **feature/replay** — allow replaying the game

## How to Run
```bash
python game/game.py
